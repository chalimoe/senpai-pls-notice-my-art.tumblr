Through my research, it has become clear that "online" and "offline" are no longer binary distinctions. As sociologist and Media theorist Nathan Jurgenson states, "we are not crossing in and out of separate digital and physical realities, ala the Matrix, but instead live in one reality that is augmented by atoms and bits."[1]  This paper investigates how the affective art object can make our digitally augmented reality visible, stripping away the false dichotomy of "online" and "offline".
